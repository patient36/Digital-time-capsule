## Description

**Message Your Future Self** allows you to send messages, reflections, and goals to your future self. It's a digital time capsule where you can capture your thoughts, aspirations, and life updates today and revisit them in the future.

Ever wondered what your future self would think about your current journey? This app helps you send messages that will be unlocked on a specific future date—whether it's a year from now, five years from now, or even a decade later. A simple way to preserve your thoughts, dreams, and memories over time.

## Features

- **Write to Your Future Self**: Record your thoughts, reflections, and goals.
- **Set a Future Date**: Choose when you want your message to be unlocked—whether it's tomorrow, next year, or further down the road.
- **Secure and Private**: Your messages are stored securely and only accessible when it's time to read them.
- **Track Your Progress**: Revisit your past goals and reflections to see how far you've come.

## How It Works

1. **Write Your Message**: Write a letter or note to your future self. It can be anything—from a personal message to a reminder or a list of goals.
2. **Set a Date**: Choose a date for when you want to read your message.
3. **Send It to the Future**: Submit the message, and it will be securely stored and scheduled for delivery at the specified time.
4. **Future Notification**: You’ll receive a notification when it’s time to open your message and see how much has changed!
